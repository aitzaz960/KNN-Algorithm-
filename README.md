# KNN-Algorithm-
In this project I have implemented the KNN algorithm in Python which is a famous supervised learning algorithm. Moreover I have also calculated accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score by using confusion matrix. For this algo, I have used the dataset of car evaluation. This dataset consisted of 7 features and 1728 records. Among these 7 features only two features had numeric values while all other features stored the string values. So I had to convert each string to an integer value. The target class of the data set was the evaluation where we had to tell whether this car is unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good. More info about this data set can be seen in car.data file.
